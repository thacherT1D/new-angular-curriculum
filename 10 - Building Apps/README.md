# Building Angular Apps

The lessons in this section all relate to the the following standard:

> Build an Angular application with routes (W0044)

In order to demonstrate that you've mastered the core concepts, you will be asked to build an app where:

- App has multiple routes, configured with clean urls (html5Mode)
- Uses builtin directives and filters (ng-repeat, ng-class, ng-if etc...)
- Uses data-binding (that is, doesn't use direct DOM manipulation)
- Uses Components to organize code
- Uses ui-router
- Uses the following patterns from the Angular 1 Styleguide:
  - [iifes](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#iife)
  - [Named Functions](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#named-vs-anonymous-functions)
  - [ControllerAs](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#controllers)
  - [Bindable Members Up Top](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#bindable-members-up-top)
  - [Naming Guidelines](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#naming)
  - [Controller Names](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#controller-names)
  - [Folders-By-Feature Structure](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#folders-by-feature-structure)

## How to proceed

We think the best way for you master Angular 1 fundamentals is to follow the lessons sequentially.

However, if you already know some Angular, or if you'd like to see how far you can go on your own, feel free to attempt [the Reddit Clone assessment](19 - Assessment: Reddit Clone).

If you are super ambitious and/or have a project that you'd like to build to add to your portfolio, you can build your own app as long as it satisfies the criteria above.  The process for doing that is:

- Make a quick list of stories / wireframes (nothing fancy, whiteboard picture is fine)
- Ask an instructor if the app is complex enough / on par with the Reddit clone

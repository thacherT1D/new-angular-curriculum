The lessons in this section all relate to the the following standard:

> Build an Angular application with routes (W0044)

## Assessment

[Angular Reddit Clone](90 - Assessment: Reddit Clone.md)

## How to proceed

We think the best way for you master Angular 1 fundamentals is to follow the lessons sequentially.

However, if you already know some Angular, or if you'd like to see how far you can go on your own, feel free to attempt [the Reddit Clone assessment](90 - Assessment: Reddit Clone.md).

If you are super ambitious and/or have a project that you'd like to build to add to your portfolio, you can build your own app as long as it satisfies the criteria above.  The process for doing that is:

- Make a quick list of stories / wireframes (nothing fancy, whiteboard picture is fine)
- Ask an instructor if the app is complex enough / on par with the Reddit clone

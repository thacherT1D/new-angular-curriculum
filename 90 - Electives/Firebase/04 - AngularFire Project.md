# AngularFire Project

**Exercise** Revisit the Angular Reddit Clone project from Unit 1 Lesson 7.  Implement a backend using Firebase. The functionality should stay exactly the same from a user's point of view.  The only difference is that data will now persist.  

A few things to consider:

* Will you store posts and comments separately or together in Firebase?
* Do you need to use $firebaseObject, $firebaseArray, or both?

**Stretch Exercise** Implement a realtime student understanding tracker.  This is definitely a bonus challenge because it requires you to use some new AngularFire methods and incorporate a charting library. Watch the following video for details.

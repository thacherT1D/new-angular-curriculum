# Connecting Angular apps to an API

The lessons in this section all relate to the the following standard:

> Build an Angular CRUD application against an HTTP API (W0045)

## Unit Overview

In a typical data-backed Angular 1 application you allow users to:

- Fetch data from, and send data to, a server (`$http`)
- Navigate through the app with links (routing with `ui-router`)

In order to use `$http` and `ui-router` you'll also need to learn a little bit about:

- Dependency Injection
- Integrating Angular with Express

## Assessment

To demonstrate your master of building CRUD apps against an API you will [integrate your Reddit Clone with a server-side API](95 - Assessment: Reddit Clone with API.md).

## How to proceed

**Stretch**

Angular 1 has a neat library called [`ngResource`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource) which can simplify basic REST / CRUD operations with a server.
